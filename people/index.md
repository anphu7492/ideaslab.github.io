IDEAS's research includes design and implementation of algebraic, geometric, and scientific algorithms and their applications to computer graphics, robotics, virtual environments, CAD/CAM, acoustics, pedestrian dynamics, and medical simulation. Some recent work includes combining these methods with machine learning, computer vision and physically-based modeling for Autonomous Driving, Affective Computing and Reconstructing Reality. In addition to publishing papers at the leading venues, we have a long history of developing software packages and transitioning our technology into industrial products.
