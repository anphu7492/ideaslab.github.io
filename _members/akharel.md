Hello everyone, I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at Purdue University. I am interested in media forensics to detect deepfake contents using affective cues.

Before coming to Purdue, I completed my undergraduate degree with a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of Southern Mississippi.
