Paige Bryan is an undergraduate student at Purdue University from Seattle, Washington. She is pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering with minors in Computer Science and Communications. Paige is expected to graduate in the Spring of 2027.

Over the summer, she interned with John Deere's Construction and Forestry Advanced Research and Development Team, where she contributed to the DUNE autonomous dump truck path planning project by processing LiDAR data and programming in MATLAB. At Purdue, Paige also served as the PR coordinator for the Industrial Roundtable, the second-largest student-run career fair in the U.S.

Her research interests include autonomous systems, sensor integration, control systems, and human-centered robotics. Currently, Paige is engaged in computer science research in the IDEAS lab, focusing on robotic dogs. After graduation, she is looking forward to building a career in robotics.
