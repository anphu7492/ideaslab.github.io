I am a first year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department in Purdue University. I am very much interested in learning-based computer graphics and integrating machine learning into VR/AR. My current research is about using LLM and computer graphics to redirect users in the virtual environment to get them better involved.

Prior to Purdue University, I obtained B.S in computer science and B.A. in visual fine arts at Union College, and M.S. in computer science at Northwestern University. My previous research focus was to explore new depth estimation approaches in optics and biological fields.

Besides academics, I really like to play tennis, watch old (especially Italian) films, and visit museums and galleries. Feel free to email me if we have similar research area or hobby!
