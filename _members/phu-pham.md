Phu is a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at Purdue University. I'm broadly interested in machine learning (deep learning, reinforcement learning) and robotics. My recent work focused on developing deep neural network architectures for machine translation, object detection, and image captioning.

Previously, I received an M.Sc. in Big data and large-scale computing and a minor in machine learning and data mining. I also earned my B.E. in Information Technology and have 4.5 years of working experience.
