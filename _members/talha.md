I am a PhD student at IDEAS Lab, where I focus on developing Machine Learning methods for Robot Motion Planning and Scene Understanding. Before coming to Purdue, I worked at Pointivo, Inc., developing and deploying ML pipelines for 3D asset inspection. I did my Bachelors from UET Lahore and my Masters from LUMS.
