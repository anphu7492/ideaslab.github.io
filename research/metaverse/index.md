### Overview

The IDEAS research group at Purdue conducts a wide range of research in the area of Metaverse/AR/VR, including generating virtual agents with appropriate emotional expressiveness for a variety of human-agent interactions in social contexts, such as co-habiting and navigating in the same space, conducting conversations, and engaging human audiences, to Redirected walking (RDW) as a locomotion interface that allows users to naturally explore VEs that are larger than or different from the physical tracked space while minimizing how often the user collides with obstacles in the physical environment or designing novel approaches for creating user-centric social experiences in virtual environments that are populated with both user controlled avatars, and intelligent virtual agents.
