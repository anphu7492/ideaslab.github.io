### Overview
{:.left}
Exploring virtual environments/Metaverse is an integral part of immersive virtual experiences. Real walking is known to provide benefits to sense of presence and task performance that other locomotion interfaces cannot provide. Using an intuitive locomotion interface like real walking has benefits to all virtual experiences for which travel is crucial, such as virtual house tours and training applications. Our work on Redirected walking (RDW) as a locomotion interface allows users to naturally explore VEs that are larger than or different from the physical tracked space, while minimizing how often the user collides with obstacles in the physical environment.
