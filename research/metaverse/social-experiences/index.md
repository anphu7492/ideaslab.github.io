# User-centric social experiences

### Overview
{:.left}
We developed novel approaches for creating user-centric social experiences in virtual environments that are populated with both user controlled avatars, and intelligent virtual agents. We propose algorithms to increase the motion, and behavioral realism of the virtual agents, thus creating immersive virtual experiences. Agents are capable of finding collision-free paths in complex environments, and interacting with the avatars using natural language processing and generation, as well as non-verbal behaviours such as gazing, gesturing, facial expressions etc. We also built a multi-agent simulation framework that can generate pausible behaviors and full body motion for hundreds of agents at interactive rates.
