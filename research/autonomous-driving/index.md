### Overview
{:.left}

Autonomous Driving has become one of the most anticipated technologies in both industry and academic research groups. Most of the current efforts in autonomous driving have found success in idealistic conditions such as sparse and homogeneous traffic on highways and urban areas. The GAMMA group, instead, aims to advance autonomous driving research in highly dense and heterogeneous traffic conditions that characterizes social and psychological aspects of human drivers in uncertain environments.
