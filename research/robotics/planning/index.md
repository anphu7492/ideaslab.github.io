<!-- ![affect2mm](/images/research/affect2mm.png) -->

### Overview
{:.left}

Motion planning is a fundamental problem in robotics. It may be stated as finding a path for a robot or agent, such that the robot or agent may move along this path from its initial configuration to goal configuration without colliding with any static obstacles or other robots or agents in the environment. Motion planning algorithms are used in many fields, including bioinformatics, character animation, computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM), industrial automation, robotic surgery, and single and multiple robot navigation in both two and three dimensions.
