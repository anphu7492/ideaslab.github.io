### Overview
{:.left}

Crowd and multi-agent simulation is the process of simulating large numbers of people, creatures, or other characters, each interacting in one environment. These actors are expected to move to their goals, interact with their environment, and respond to each other. Crowd simulations have many uses, including improving architectural planning, enhancing training environments and virtual realities, and driving artificially-intelligent (AI) characters in games and movies. Our group has worked on many problems in crowd simulation, including fast, guaranteed, collision avoidance, real-time path and motion planning, crowd flows, and directed behaviors.
