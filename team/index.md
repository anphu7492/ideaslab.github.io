IDEAS's research includes design and implementation of algebraic, geometric, and scientific algorithms and their applications to computer graphics, robotics, virtual environments, CAD/CAM, acoustics, pedestrian dynamics, and medical simulation. Some recent work includes combining these methods with machine learning, computer vision and physically-based modeling for Autonomous Driving, Affective Computing and Reconstructing Reality. In addition to publishing papers at the leading venues, we have a long history of developing software packages and transitioning our technology into industrial products.

## Join us

#### Post Dogtoral Researcher

I'm hiring multiple Postdoctoral Research Associates in the interdisciplinery areas of AI, affective computing, computer graphics and multi-agent planning. Please send me an email with your resume. [Advertisment link here!](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/ab/postdoc.pdf)

#### Graduate students

If you're looking for graduate admissions (MS/PhD) , please email me and apply to the Purdue CS. Please note that all admission decisions are taken by the committee.

If you're already a student at Purdue, the best way to increase the chances of a response to an e-mail is to read one of my recent papers and include a concise paragraph with the benefits and drawbacks of the main idea as well as possible improvements you'd be interested to try and send me an email with your CV and background.
